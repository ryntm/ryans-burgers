Welcome to Ryan's Burger - where you can make any burger that you can image!

We can make any burger! Just type it in the text field and hit the create button!

Once you create the burger, it will appear in the 'New Burgers' area. There will be a "Devour" button which will allow you to eat your burger!

Not hungry yet? No worries! You can back to your burgers when you are. They will still be here when you come back!

Did you make a mistake? Did you make a squid and peanut butter burger? Too bad, we don't waste food here, it is not going anywhere until you eat it. 

After you eat any burger, you have an option to hide it. In the event you a ashamed of what you created and ate.
